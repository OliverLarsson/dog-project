### What is this project? 
Our dog fitness tracker project is a Figma prototype of an iOS app built to help dog owners keep track of their dog's eating habits, exercise, and general health. This site includes all links to the Prototype, Group Tasks, and Interview/Survey questions that we created along the way. The sections below are organized in chronological order, aside from the Prototype that we included directly below for convenience.

### Prototype

***********************

### Group Task 1

This involved individual brainstorming assignments, so we have no files here :). 

***********************

### Group Task 2

Group Task 2 was where we created a project plan and declared what research we would conduct for Group Task 3.

### Group Task 4

Group Task 4 was where we created a paper prototype for our Figma prototype. The link at the very bottom of this document no longer links to the initial prototype since we separated our prototype versions A & B into different Figma docs.

### Group Task 6

Group Task 6 was where we finalized our Figma prototype using the UARs from Group Task 5 and wrote an initial storyboard for our final video.
